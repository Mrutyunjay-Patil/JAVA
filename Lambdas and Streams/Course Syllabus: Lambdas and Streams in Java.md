# Course Syllabus: Lambdas and Streams in Java

## Course Overview
This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Java's functional programming features, particularly Lambdas and Streams. Starting from the fundamentals of functional interfaces and lambda expressions, the course gradually progresses to advanced stream operations on collections such as lists, maps, and sets. By the end of the course, students will be well-versed in writing, understanding, and optimizing code using Lambdas and Streams, with a strong grasp of best practices and performance considerations.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the principles of functional programming in Java.
- Gain proficiency in lambda expressions, method references, and functional interfaces.
- Learn how to work with Java Streams to process collections in a functional style.
- Master advanced stream operations including filtering, mapping, reduction, grouping, and parallel streams.
- Develop practical skills through hands-on exercises, projects, and code reviews.
- Be able to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using lambdas and streams.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java programming (syntax, classes, collections, exception handling).
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts.

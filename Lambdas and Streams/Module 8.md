# Module 8: Capstone Project and Review

In the final module, students apply everything they've learned about Lambdas and Streams in a comprehensive capstone project. This is followed by a review week that recaps key concepts, discusses advanced topics, and gathers feedback for future improvement.

## Week 15: Capstone Project

### 15.1 Project Overview
Students will undertake a comprehensive project that requires the use of Lambdas and Streams to solve a complex problem. Examples of such projects include:
- Building a data processing pipeline for large data sets.
- Parsing and analyzing files (e.g., log files, CSV data).
- Creating simple analytics or reporting tools.

### 15.2 Project Milestones and Peer Reviews
- **Project Proposal:** Outline the problem, objectives, and approach using Lambdas and Streams.
- **Milestones:**
  - **Milestone 1:** Set up the project structure, gather input data, and demonstrate basic stream usage.
  - **Milestone 2:** Implement core processing logic using advanced stream operations and lambdas.
  - **Milestone 3:** Optimize and refine the code, ensuring thread safety if using parallel streams.
  - **Final Submission:** Complete implementation, documentation, and testing.
- **Peer Reviews:** At each milestone, students present their progress, get feedback from peers, and discuss improvements.

### 15.3 Presentations
- Students present their projects to the class, explaining how they used Lambdas and Streams.
- Demonstrations of features, discussion of challenges faced, and how they solved them.
- Q&A sessions to learn from different approaches and solutions.

**Tips for Success:**
- Start with a clear plan and break the problem down into smaller parts.
- Use the concepts learned throughout the course to build robust and efficient solutions.
- Seek feedback early and often to refine your approach.

## Week 16: Course Review and Future Learning Paths

### 16.1 Recap of Key Concepts and Advanced Topics
- **Review Sessions:** Summarize major concepts:
  - Functional interfaces and lambdas.
  - Stream API basics and advanced operations.
  - Parallel streams and concurrency.
  - Best practices, testing, and debugging.
- **Advanced Topics:** Briefly touch on topics that extend beyond the course:
  - Reactive Streams: Asynchronous stream processing.
  - CompletableFuture: Handling asynchronous programming with futures.
  - Other functional programming libraries and paradigms.

### 16.2 Q&A Session and Open Discussion
- Students ask questions about any unclear topics or seek advice on advanced use cases.
- Open discussion on best practices, learning resources, and career advice for functional programming in Java.

### 16.3 Feedback and Course Improvement Discussion
- Collect feedback from students about what worked well and what could be improved.
- Discuss suggestions for future iterations of the course or additional topics students are interested in.

### 16.4 Looking Forward: Future Learning Paths
- Recommendations for books, online courses, and communities to continue learning.
- Exploring other Java features such as Reactive Programming, Microservices, or Advanced Concurrency.
- Encouraging participation in open-source projects or community meetups to apply skills in real-world scenarios.

**End-of-Course Reflection:**
- Reflect on the journey from basic lambdas to advanced stream processing.
- Set personal goals for further improvement and application of learned skills in upcoming projects or career opportunities.

**Final Note:**
The capstone project and review week are designed to consolidate knowledge, apply it to solve real problems, and prepare for continued learning. Students should feel confident in their ability to use Lambdas and Streams effectively and be inspired to explore further advanced topics in Java programming.
